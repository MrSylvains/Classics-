Project Goal:
To design a basic off-grid monitoring system that helps track and manage essential resources for off-grid living. The system will monitor:

 Solar battery levels

Water tank capacity

Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity)

Functionality Preview:

Use Python classes to represent key components (Battery, WaterTank, Environment).

Implement functions to update and display the status of each system.

Store and manage data using dictionaries or simple file-based logs.

Future-ready design for potential integration with sensors or dashboards.

Why this project?
As sustainable living becomes more common, it's important to have tools that allow people to monitor their off-grid setups efficiently. This project builds foundational skills in object-oriented programming and data handling while offering real-world utility.
