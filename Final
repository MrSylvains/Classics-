I plan to build a Music Playlist Manager using Python. This project will serve as a digital tool to store and manage a personal music collection, allowing users to organize songs by title, artist, and duration. It will include functionality to add new songs, update song details, and print the entire playlist. This project will help me practice working with data structures and user input while creating a functional and organized system for music enthusiasts.
Steps:Create a dictionary called playlist that stores multiple songs, each as a dictionary with:

title

artist

duration (in minutes)

Print the initial playlist.

Update the duration of one of the songs.

Print the playlist before and after the update.

Add a new song to the playlist.

Print the updated playlist.

# Step 1: Create the initial playlist as a dictionary of dictionaries
playlist = {}

# Step 2: Add initial songs to the playlist
playlist['Song1'] = {}
playlist['Song1']['title'] = 'Shape of You'
playlist['Song1']['artist'] = 'Ed Sheeran'
playlist['Song1']['duration'] = 4.24

playlist['Song2'] = {}
playlist['Song2']['title'] = 'Bohemian Rhapsody'
playlist['Song2']['artist'] = 'Queen'
playlist['Song2']['duration'] = 5.55

# Step 3: Print the initial playlist
print("Initial Playlist:")
print(playlist)

# Step 4: Modify the duration of one of the songs
print("\nUpdating the duration of 'Shape of You' to 4.30 minutes...")
playlist['Song1']['duration'] = 4.30

# Step 5: Print the playlist after the update
print("\nPlaylist after updating duration:")
print(playlist)

# Step 6: Add a new song to the playlist
playlist['Song3'] = {}
playlist['Song3']['title'] = 'Stairway to Heaven'
playlist['Song3']['artist'] = 'Led Zeppelin'
playlist['Song3']['duration'] = 8.02

# Step 7: Print the updated playlist
print("\nUpdated Playlist with new song added:")
print(playlist)
